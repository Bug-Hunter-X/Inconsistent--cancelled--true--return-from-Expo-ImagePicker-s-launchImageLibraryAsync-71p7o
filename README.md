This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's ImagePicker API where `launchImageLibraryAsync` can return `{cancelled: true}` despite a successful image selection. The issue is inconsistent and leads to unexpected application behavior. The solution provides a workaround that checks for the presence of the selected image URI, ensuring that a valid selection is used regardless of the `cancelled` flag.  The bug is reproducible, and the fix enhances the robustness of image selection.
